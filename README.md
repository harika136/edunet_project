# Employees_Burnout_Prediction

The problem at hand is to analyze and predict employee burnout within an organization. The objective is to develop a model that can assess the likelihood of burnout for individual employees based on various factors such as workload, work-life balance, job satisfaction, organizational support, and personal characteristics.

* Introduction 
    * Overview of employee burnout
    * Importance of addressing employee burnout 
    * Goals of the analysis and prediction

* Data Collection 
   * Sources of data (employee surveys, HR records, performance evaluations, external benchmarks) 
   * Data collection process
* Feature Selection
   * Identification of relevant features 
   * Selection criteria for feature inclusion
* Data Analysis 
   * Exploratory data analysis 
   * Correlation analysis between variables and burnout 
   * Identification of patterns or trends
* Model Development 
   * Selection of machine learning algorithms 
   * Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets 
   * Model training and testing
* Model Evaluation
   * Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) 
   * Cross-validation techniques
   * Evaluation of model performance using regressions like Linear , Random Forest , Ada Boost etcâ€¦
